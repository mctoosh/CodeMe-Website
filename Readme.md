## What did I do in the Website
For my home page I created a 4 navigation links, each linked is styled with CSS. I also have a logo. the website also includes a 3 image slide show. the website also contains content about the website. The website has three images of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each section describes what these sections are. For my Activity web page I created five different features which were created using either, HTML, CSS, CSS animation, or JavaScript. the first feature is a Wikipedia search, the second feature is a color picker, the third feature is SVG design, the fourth feature is a name storage, and the last feature is a CSS animation. For my about page I discussed further about what the website is about. In the web page I also included a section talking about the team of the company. I have included four images of the staffs. Finally, for my contact page I created a contact for where the visitors could contact us. I also included an google image to inform the visitors where the company is located. At the bottom of each web page, there is a site map and a social media link icons, these icons will take you to the social media page of the company. Furthermore, the website has a go to top feature, that allows the visitor to go back to the top.

## Why I created My Website
The reason why I made the website was because of my interest in web development. I wanted to make the visitors aware of what web development is. I wanted to talk about the different web development languages such as, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how they could be used to make a website. I also wanted to show on my website what these web development languages could do.
