## Testing's
I have carried out the testing of seeing whether the website is responsive or not. The way I carried out the test was by minimising the screen, once the screen was minimised, it hit the breakpoint where the images and the texts all became aligned. Furthermore, the navigation bar also changed from inline menu to hamburger menu as soon as the breakpoint was hit.

## Usability Testing
I have carried out a usability questionnaire regarding my website. I asked them whether the website was easy to use or difficult and whether they have enjoyed using the website. below there is an image of the questionnaires.

## PARC
Proximity: I have included proximity in my website by having items that are related grouped close together such as, I have a column and a row where, where each describe and talk about HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I also have the social media icons grouped together so the visitor is able to find the rest of the social media easily. I also have different navigation links, where each web page has related content within it.

Alignment: I have aligned all my webpages so that they are visually connected, such as, on my activity web page, I have aligned all the borders vertically and horizontally. Furthermore, in my homepage the image slider is vertically aligned with the rest of the contents.  I have also made sure that the icons are horizontally aligned.

Repetition: I made sure that my website had some elements of repetition, especially the colour. The website mainly uses the colour green, where the logo, the navigation link hovers, the icons, the footer, the borders are all using the colour green. This is so that the website could have a consistency in the way it looks and feels towards the visitors. Furthermore, I have also made sure that the website has a consistency of layout.

Contrast: The contrast is mainly used to distinguish two or more things in a website such as a header from a paragraph.  I have done this where in my website I use semantic tags such as h1 tags and p tags. This is important for the website to have as it allows the website to have the accessibility features.

## Problems Faced
The problem that I faced in my website is the CSS error. The error that I get on my CSS is s value error, where the validator is informing me that the display hidden is not a display value: hidden. I have tried to sort this issue out by asking my peers and classmates, however, they were not able to figure out the error. Furthermore, another error that I am getting on my CSS is the key frames. In this error the validator is informing me that there is a parse error from {left: 0px ;} to {left: 150px ;}, me and my friends have tried to correct this error, however, we were not able to figure out the solution.

## What did I do in the Website
For my home page I created a 4 navigation links, each linked is styled with CSS. I also have a logo. The website also includes a 3 image slide show. The website also contains content about the website. The website has three images of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each section describes what these sections are. For my website I have used the semantic tags, such as, section tag, header tag, footer tag, and many more. I have used the semantic tags as it allows the website to have the accessibility  features. For my Activity web page I created five different features which were created using either, HTML, CSS, CSS animation, or JavaScript. The first feature is a Wikipedia search, the second feature is a colour picker, the third feature is SVG design, the fourth feature is a name storage, and the last feature is a CSS animation. For my about page I discussed further about what the website is about. In the web page I also included a section talking about the team of the company. I have included four images of the staffs. Finally, for my contact page I created a contact for where the visitors could contact us. I also included a google image to inform the visitors where the company is located. At the bottom of each web page, there is a site map and a social media link icons, these icons will take you to the social media page of the company. Furthermore, the website has a go to top feature that allows the visitor to go back to the top.

## Why I created My Website
The reason why I made the website was because of my interest in web development. I was mainly influenced by the way the website www.code.org looks. I wanted to make the visitors aware of what web development is. I wanted to talk about the different web development languages such as, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how they could be used to make a website. I also wanted to show on my website what these web development languages could do.
